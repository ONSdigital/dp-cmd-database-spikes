#### Neo4j
##### Points for Neo4j:

- Great documentation
- Active community
- Most widely used graph database
- Commercial support available

##### Points against Neo4j:

- Potentially an expensive enterprise license required
- Uses proprietary query language (cypher)

#### OrientDB

##### Points for OrientDB:

- Marketed as a multi model DB. A document store with graph capability
- uses plain sql language with some extensions for graph specific functions
- Uses common tinkerpop framework

##### Points against OrientDB:

- A lot of online commentary about negative experiences. Its hard to get a feel for if this is now solved

#### JanusGraph

##### Points for JanusGraph:

- Forked from the successful and widely used TitanDb
- Uses common tinkerpop framework

##### Points against JanusGraph:

- As it is a recent fork from Titan on the surface it appears to be less mature than the others. If you also consider how good TitanDB looks in the comparisons then JanusDB looks promising.
